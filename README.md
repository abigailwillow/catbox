# catbox
You send it a cat, and it might send you one back. Magical...

## Usage
1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
2. Open a command prompt in the root folder and run `npm install discord.js`
3. Change `config-example.json` to your needs and rename it to `config.json`.
4. In that command prompt from earlier write `node catbox.js` and watch the magic happen.

**NOTE:** Data is currently broken, you should create a folder called `backups`, a file called "currency.json" and a file called "leaderboard.json" in `/data`. All should work after adding "{}" in both files. If you can't figure it out feel free to contact me or whatever.

## Cat
Thanks to everyone who helped me with this project. Here's a cat.
