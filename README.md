# Catbox

[Add catbox to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1467528148567724205&permissions=8&scope=bot)

## Usage

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Duplicate `config-example.json` and rename to `config.json`, then change to your needs.
4. Run `npm start` and watch the magic happen.

> [!NOTE]
> Automatic setup of the necessary player and temporary data is currently broken. To get around this, create a folder called `backups`, then two files called `temp.json` and `userdata.json` in `/data`. All should work after adding `{}` in temp and `[]` in userdata.
