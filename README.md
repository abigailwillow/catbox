# catbox

You send it a cat, and it might send you one back. Magical...

## Usage

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
2. Open a command prompt in the root folder and run `npm install discord.js`
3. Change `config-example.json` to your needs and rename it to `config.json`.
4. In that command prompt from earlier write `node catbox.js` and watch the magic happen.

**NOTE:** Data is currently kinda broken, you should create a folder called `backups`, a file called 'temp.json' and a file called 'userdata.json' in `/data`. All should work after adding `{}` in temp and `[]` in userdata. If you can't figure it out feel free to contact me or whatever.
